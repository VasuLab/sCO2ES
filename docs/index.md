# Overview

This is the reference for the Supercritical CO₂ Energy Storage (sCO₂ES) package (`sco2es`). The solvers are written 
entirely in Python, using [Numba](https://numba.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) wherever possible for just-in-time (JIT) compilation and parallelization 
to maximize performance.

## Installation

This package can be installed with `pip`:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/VasuLab/sco2es.git
```
